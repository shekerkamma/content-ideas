# Vision Schema

The `vision.json` file captures all founder answers from the PLAID intake conversation. It is the single input for document generation.

## Type Definition

```typescript
interface Vision {
  meta: {
    createdAt: string;          // ISO 8601 timestamp
    updatedAt: string;          // ISO 8601 timestamp
    version: "1.1";             // Schema version
    plaidVersion: "1.0";        // PLAID skill version
  };

  creator: {
    name: string;               // Founder's name
    expertise: string;          // Professional background / area of expertise
    background: string;         // Their story — what led them here
  };

  purpose: {
    whoYouHelp: string;         // Target audience description
    problemYouSolve: string;    // The pain point
    desiredTransformation: string; // Before → after for the user
    whyYou: string;             // Founder-market fit narrative
  };

  product: {
    name: string;               // Product name
    oneLiner: string;           // One-sentence description
    howItWorks: string;         // Core user flow narrative
    keyCapabilities: string[];  // 3-5 main capabilities
    platform: "web" | "mobile" | "desktop" | "cross-platform";
    marketDifferentiation: string; // What makes it different
    magicMoment: string;        // The "aha" moment description
  };

  audience: {
    primaryUser: string;        // Detailed primary persona
    secondaryUsers: string[];   // 2-3 secondary user groups
    currentAlternatives: string; // What people use today
    frustrations: string;       // What's broken about alternatives
  };

  business: {
    revenueModel: "subscription" | "freemium" | "one-time" | "marketplace" | "ad-supported" | "free";
    initialGoal: string;        // 90-day success definition
    sixMonthVision: string;     // 6-month vision
    constraints: string;        // Time, money, skills, etc.
    goToMarket: string;         // GTM approach
  };

  feeling: {
    brandPersonality: string;   // Brand personality archetype
    toneOfVoice: string;        // How the product communicates
  };
  // Note: visualMood and antiPatterns were removed in v1.1 — visual identity
  // (including visual anti-patterns) is captured in docs/design.md via
  // /plaid design from image references, not in vision.json.

  techStack: {
    appType: "web" | "mobile" | "desktop" | "cross-platform";
    frontend: {
      choice: string;           // e.g. "Next.js"
      rationale: string;        // Why this was chosen
    };
    backend: {
      choice: string;           // e.g. "Convex"
      rationale: string;
    };
    database: {
      choice: string;           // e.g. "Convex Database"
      rationale: string;
    };
    auth: {
      choice: string;           // e.g. "Clerk"
      rationale: string;
    };
    payments: {
      choice: string;           // e.g. "Polar" — empty string if free
      rationale: string;
    };
  };

  tooling: {
    codingAgent: "claude-code" | "cursor" | "windsurf" | "copilot" | "other";
    codingAgentName?: string;   // Only if codingAgent is "other"
  };
}
```

## Schema Versioning

The `meta.version` field tracks the schema version — the shape of `vision.json` (what fields exist, their types, valid enum values). The `meta.plaidVersion` field tracks which version of the PLAID skill created the file.

When the schema changes (fields added, removed, renamed, or types changed), `CURRENT_VERSION` in `scripts/validate-vision.js` is bumped and a migration function is added to the `migrations` registry.

### How migrations work

- Each migration transforms a vision object from version N to version N+1.
- Migrations chain: a file at 1.0 migrates through 1.0→1.1→1.2 to reach the current version.
- Running `node scripts/validate-vision.js` without flags detects outdated files and reports what migrations are pending.
- Running `node scripts/validate-vision.js --migrate` applies all pending migrations in sequence, writes the updated file, and then validates it.
- Migrations update `meta.version` to the new version and set `meta.updatedAt` to the current timestamp.

### Adding a new migration

1. Bump `CURRENT_VERSION` in `scripts/validate-vision.js` (e.g. `'1.0'` → `'1.1'`).
2. Add an entry to the `migrations` object keyed by the version you're migrating FROM:
   ```javascript
   '1.0': (vision) => {
     // transform vision from 1.0 → 1.1
     vision.meta.version = '1.1';
     return vision;
   }
   ```
3. Update the `validate()` function to check any new or changed fields.
4. Update this schema document and the example below to reflect the new shape.

### Migration history

**1.0 → 1.1** — Removed `feeling.visualMood` and `feeling.antiPatterns`. Visual identity (including visual anti-patterns) is now captured in `docs/design.md` via `/plaid design`, generated from image references rather than text descriptions. The migration deletes both fields if present.

## Field Rules

- **No empty strings** in required fields. If the founder skipped a question, use the AI-suggested default.
- **Arrays** (keyCapabilities, secondaryUsers) must have at least 1 item.
- **techStack.payments** can have empty strings for choice and rationale if revenue model is “free”.
- **techStack.database**, **techStack.auth**, and **techStack.payments** may have `"None"` as the choice value for mobile apps that don’t need these layers. Include a rationale explaining why (e.g. “App uses on-device storage only”).
- **tooling.codingAgentName** is only present when codingAgent is “other”.
- **meta.createdAt** and **meta.updatedAt** should be set to the current ISO 8601 timestamp when the file is first created.

    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "expertise": "UX design and user research — 8 years at enterprise SaaS companies",
    "background": "I've spent nearly a decade watching enterprise software make simple tasks painful. I ran user research at two B2B SaaS companies and saw the same pattern: features shipped without talking to users, redesigns that made things worse, and research insights that lived in slide decks nobody read. I want to build the tool I wished I had."
  },
  "purpose": {
    "whoYouHelp": "Product managers and UX researchers at mid-size SaaS companies (50-500 employees) who need to make user research a continuous practice, not a one-off project",
    "problemYouSolve": "User research insights get trapped in documents, slide decks, and individual people's heads. When a PM needs to make a decision, they can't quickly find what the team already knows about their users. So they either guess, re-run research that was already done, or skip research entirely.",
    "desiredTransformation": "Product teams make every decision with confidence because user insights are organized, searchable, and connected to the features they inform. Research becomes a living knowledge base, not a graveyard of PDFs.",
    "whyYou": "I've been the researcher whose work got ignored because it was buried in Notion docs. I've also been the PM who couldn't find the research when I needed it. I've lived both sides of this problem and I know exactly where the handoff breaks down."

    "howItWorks": "A researcher uploads interview notes, survey results, or usability test recordings.

    "platform": "web",
    "marketDifferentiation": "Unlike Dovetail and Condens which focus on analysis workflows, InsightHub focuses on the moment of decision — when a PM or designer needs an answer. It's not a research tool, it's a research memory that the whole team shares.",
    "magicMoment": "A PM is debating a feature approach in a meeting. They search InsightHub, and within 10 seconds find three user interview quotes that directly address their question. The team makes a confident decision in minutes instead of scheduling another round of research."

  "audience": {
    "primaryUser": "Maya, 32, Senior PM at a 200-person B2B SaaS company. She manages a product area with 3 squads. Her researchers do great work but she can never find it when she needs it.

    ],
    "currentAlternatives": "Dovetail (expensive, focused on analysis not retrieval), Notion databases (manual tagging, hard to search), Google Drive folders (chaotic, unsearchable), Confluence pages (where research goes to die), or just asking the researcher directly (doesn't scale, single point of failure)",
    "frustrations": "Existing tools are either too heavyweight (Dovetail requires researchers to do extensive tagging and analysis before anything is useful) or too lightweight (Notion/Drive have no semantic understanding — you have to know the exact words to search for). The real frustration is the gap between 'we did the research' and 'we used the research.'"

    "constraints": "Building part-time (20 hrs/week) while freelancing. Budget: $500/month for tools and infrastructure. Strong on design and UX, moderate on frontend development, limited backend experience — hence the need for a managed backend.",
    "goToMarket": "Build in public on Twitter/X and LinkedIn, targeting the product management and UX research community. Share weekly insights about research operationalization. Launch beta on Product Hunt. Partner with 2-3 PM community leaders for early access reviews."
