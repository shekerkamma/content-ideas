name: session-handoff
description: Use when the user says "session handoff", "wrap up session", "hand off", "handoff summary", or wants a structured end-of-session summary before starting a fresh session. Produces a chat-only handoff covering decisions, shipped changes, key files, running state, verification steps, deferrals, and open questions so a fresh agent (in Codex or Claude Code) can continue seamlessly.

# Session Handoff

Produce a repeatable end-of-session summary so the user can start a fresh session (a new `codex` invocation, `codex resume`, or `/clear` in Claude Code) without losing continuity. The next agent should be able to pick up by reading this summary alone.

This is a **context-handoff artifact**, not a status report. The audience is a future instance of you, not a stakeholder.

## When to invoke

User says: "session handoff", "wrap up session", "hand off", "handoff summary", "let's wrap up", "summarize before I clear", or any near-equivalent. Also invoke proactively if the user says they're about to start a fresh session without having run it yet.

## How to produce the summary

1. **Review the full conversation**, not just the last few turns. Handoffs miss things when they only summarize recent context.
2. **Pull state from these sources (in order):**
   - Plan files referenced this session (check `~/.claude/plans/` if a plan was mentioned — shared across hosts).
   - Task/todo list state you've been tracking (TodoWrite in Claude Code, or this host's equivalent) — any in-progress or pending tasks.
   - Background processes you started — shell/process IDs are load-bearing for the next agent.
   - Files created or modified this session — you know what you touched; don't grep to re-discover.
   - Memory files written or updated (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`, if this host writes to that layer).
   - Unresolved questions — things you asked the user that never got a clear answer, or things the user asked that got deflected.
3. **Do NOT audit the filesystem.** This is synthesis of what happened in THIS session. No `git log`, no broad recursive searches. If you didn't touch it this session, it doesn't belong here.
4. **Write the handoff to `~/.claude/session-handoff.md`** (shared across hosts — if the `session-handoff` MCP tool is available, use its `end_session` tool instead of writing the file directly). This file is auto-read by the next session, whether that next session is Codex or Claude Code.
5. **Also output the summary in chat** so the user can see it immediately.

## Output template — use exactly this structure, every time

```
# Session Handoff — <one-line title of what this session was about>

## Where it started
<2-3 sentences: what the user asked for, key framing or constraints that emerged>

## Decisions locked + what shipped
- <decision or change> — <why, and where it lives (absolute path if a file)>
- ...

## Key files for next session
- `<absolute path>` — <why the next agent should read this first>
- Plan file: `<path>` (if a plan drove the session)
- Memory files touched: `<paths>` (if any)

## Running state
- Background processes: <shell/process IDs + what they are + how to kill> — or "none"
- Dev servers / ports: <url + port> — or "none"
- Open worktrees / branches: <paths> — or "none"

## Verification — how to confirm things still work
- `<command>` — <expected outcome>
- ...

## Deferred + open questions
- Deferred: <item> — <why pushed to later>
- Open: <question needing the user's input> — <context>

## Pick up here
<1-2 sentences: the single most likely next action for a fresh agent>
```

## After writing the handoff

Once the handoff file is written and the summary is displayed in chat, **immediately tell the user how to start fresh** with a message like:

> Handoff saved. Start a new session (e.g. run `codex` again, `codex resume`, or `/clear` in Claude Code) — it can resume from this handoff.

## Hard rules

1. **Write to `~/.claude/session-handoff.md` AND output in chat.** The file is the handoff mechanism (shared across hosts); the chat output is for the user's review.
2. **Never invent state.** If a section has nothing to report, write "none" — do not omit the section. Structure stability is the whole point.
3. **Absolute paths always.** The next agent may have a different working directory.
4. **If a plan file drove the session, name it first** in "Key files" so the next agent reads it before anything else.
5. **No emojis, no hype, no "great job" summaries.** Terse and concrete — paths, commands, shell/process IDs, decisions. Match the tone of a seasoned engineer handing off at end-of-shift.
6. **Background process IDs are critical.** If you started any background processes, their IDs must appear in "Running state" with the kill command — the next agent cannot find them otherwise.

## Anti-patterns — do not do these

- Summarizing the last 3 turns and calling it a handoff.
- Listing files by relative path.
- Skipping the "Running state" section because "nothing is running" — write "none" instead.
- Writing the summary to any location other than `~/.claude/session-handoff.md`.
- Adding a "what went well / what went poorly" retrospective. This isn't a retro.
- Recommending next steps beyond the single "Pick up here" line. The next agent decides; you just hand off.
