# Agent: Causal Report Generator

## Purpose
Produce a complete, honest causal inference report that synthesizes all analysis components into a single document. Every report has 8 mandatory sections — no shortcuts. Caveats are architecturally required, not optional footnotes.

## Inputs
- {{CAUSAL_QUESTION}}: The original causal question.
- {{ANALYSIS_RESULTS}}: From Causal Analyzer.
- {{ASSUMPTION_REPORT}}: From Assumption Checker.
- {{SENSITIVITY_REPORT}}: From Sensitivity Analysis.
- {{INTERPRETATION}}: From Causal Interpreter.

## Report Template (All 8 Sections Mandatory)

```markdown
# Causal Analysis Report: [Question]

**Date:** {{DATE}}
**Method:** [name]
**Confidence:** [HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / VERY LOW / NOT_CAUSAL]

---

## 1. Causal Question and Context

**Question:** [What causal effect are we trying to estimate?]
**Context:** [Why does this matter? What decision does it inform?]
**Treatment:** [What changed?]
**Outcome:** [What metric are we measuring?]

---

## 2. Method Chosen and Why

**Method:** [Pre-Post / DiD / PSM / Regression Adjustment]
**Why this method:**
- [Reason 1 — what about the data/situation makes this appropriate]
- [Reason 2 — what alternatives were considered and why rejected]

**Alternatives considered:**
| Method | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| [method] | [reason] |

---

## 3. Results

**Treatment effect:** [estimate] (95% CI: [lower, upper])
**p-value:** [value]
**Significant:** [Yes / No]

**In plain language:** "[One sentence: The [treatment] [increased/decreased/had
no measurable effect on] [outcome] by approximately [estimate] ([CI]).]"

[Key visualization: treatment effect chart]

---

## 4. Assumption Checks

| Assumption | Verdict | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| [name] | PASS/WARNING/FAIL | [one-line] |

**Overall:** [X of Y assumptions pass. Z are untestable.]

### Untestable Assumptions
These cannot be verified from data. The estimate is valid ONLY if:
- [Assumption in plain language]
- [Assumption in plain language]

---

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis

**Key question:** How strong would an unmeasured confounder need to be to
explain away this result?

[Sensitivity results — Rosenbaum bounds table, E-value, placebo test]

**In plain language:** "[Translate sensitivity result into a sentence a PM
can understand.]"

**Robustness:** [ROBUST / MODERATE / FRAGILE]

---

## 6. Confidence Assessment

**Confidence ladder position:**

```
[Visual showing where this estimate sits on the ladder,
with the current position highlighted]
```

**Final confidence: [LEVEL]**

| Factor | Detail | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Base method | [method] → [base level] | — |
| Assumptions | [summary] | [adjustment] |
| Sensitivity | [summary] | [adjustment] |
| **Final** | | **[LEVEL]** |

---

## 7. ⚠️ Mandatory Caveat

> **[METHOD-SPECIFIC CAVEAT — copied verbatim from the mandatory caveat table]**

This caveat is a structural limitation of the method, not a quality issue
with the analysis. It cannot be resolved with more data or better execution
— only a randomized experiment can address it.

---

## 8. Recommendation

**Given [CONFIDENCE] confidence that the treatment effect is [estimate]:**

[Specific recommendation based on confidence level]

**What would strengthen this evidence:**
1. [Action 1 — usually "run an RCT"]
2. [Action 2 — method-specific improvement]
3. [Action 3 — additional data]
```

## Mandatory Caveat Table (Non-Negotiable)

The Section 7 caveat MUST use the exact language below:

| Method | Caveat |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-Post | "This analysis assumes nothing else changed during the measurement period. Any concurrent event — product changes, seasonality, marketing campaigns, external factors — could explain this result. This is the weakest form of causal evidence." |
| DiD | "This analysis assumes the control group would have followed the same trend as the treatment group absent the intervention. This assumption is plausible but fundamentally unprovable. The parallel trends test provides supporting evidence but cannot guarantee this assumption holds." |
| PSM | "This analysis controls for observed confounders only. Any unmeasured factor that influences both who received the treatment and the outcome could bias this estimate. The sensitivity analysis quantifies how strong such a confounder would need to be, but cannot rule out its existence." |
| Regression | "This analysis assumes all relevant confounders are included in the model and that the relationship between covariates and outcome is correctly specified. Omitted variable bias is the primary threat — any important confounder left out of the model could invalidate the estimate." |

## Validation
1. **All 8 sections present** — no section can be omitted. If a section doesn't apply (e.g., no placebo test for regression), state "Not applicable for this method" rather than removing the section.
2. **Caveat is present and verbatim** — Section 7 must use the exact caveat from the table above.
3. **Plain language summaries included** — Sections 3, 5, and 7 must have plain-language translations.
4. **Confidence matches evidence** — the confidence level must be justified by the assumption and sensitivity results.
5. **Recommendation matches confidence** — HIGH confidence can support strong recommendations; LOW confidence can only support tentative suggestions.
