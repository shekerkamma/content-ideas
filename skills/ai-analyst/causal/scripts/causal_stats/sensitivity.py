to overturn this result?" Higher sensitivity = more robust finding.

def rosenbaum_bounds(treated_outcomes, control_outcomes, gammas=None):
    """Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis for matched pair designs.

    Tests how sensitive the treatment effect estimate is to hidden bias.
    Gamma represents the degree to which two matched units with the same
    covariates can differ in their odds of treatment due to unobserved factors.

    At gamma=1 (no hidden bias), this is a standard Wilcoxon test.
    As gamma increases, the p-value upper bound increases. The critical gamma
    is where the result first becomes non-significant.

    Args:
        treated_outcomes: array of outcomes for treated units in matched pairs.
        control_outcomes: array of outcomes for matched control units.
            Must be aligned (treated_outcomes[i] is matched to control_outcomes[i]).
        gammas: list of gamma values to test (default: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]).

    Zero-difference (tied) pairs are dropped before ranking, per standard
    practice for signed-rank statistics. Ties carry no sign information, but
    leaving them in inflates the null expectation E[T] without ever being
    able to contribute to T_obs, which drives p_upper toward 1.0 on binary
    outcomes (retention, conversion, churn) even for clearly significant
    effects.

    Returns:
        dict with: gamma_table (list of {gamma, p_upper, significant}),
        critical_gamma (first gamma where result becomes non-significant),
        t_observed, n_pairs (all input pairs), n_ties_dropped,
